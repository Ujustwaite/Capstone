abstract = {The widespread deployment of inexpensive communications technology, computational resources in the networking infrastructure, and network-enabled end devices poses an interesting problem for end users: how to locate a particular network service or device out of hundreds of thousands of accessible services and devices. This paper presents the architecture and implementation of a secure Service Discovery Service (SDS). Service providers use the SDS to advertise complex descriptions of available or already running services, while clients use the SDS to compose complex queries for locating these services. Service descriptions and queries use the extensible Markup Language (XML) to encode such factors as cost, performance, location, and device- or service-specific capabilities. The SDS provides a highly-available, fault-tolerant, incrementally scalable service for locating services in the wide-area. Security is a core component of the SDS and, where necessary, communications are both encrypted and authenticated. Furthermore, the SDS uses an hybrid access control list and capability system to control access to service information.},

title = {Integrating Variable Renewable Energy: Challenges and Solutions},
author = {Bird, L. and Milligan, M. and Lew, D.},
abstractNote = {In the U.S., a number of utilities are adopting higher penetrations of renewables, driven in part by state policies. While power systems have been designed to handle the variable nature of loads, the additional supply-side variability and uncertainty can pose new challenges for utilities and system operators. However, a variety of operational and technical solutions exist to help integrate higher penetrations of wind and solar generation. This paper explores renewable energy integration challenges and mitigation strategies that have been implemented in the U.S. and internationally, including forecasting, demand response, flexible generation, larger balancing areas or balancing area cooperation, and operational practices such as fast scheduling and dispatch.},

abstract = {Wind power is a rapidly growing source of renewable energy in many parts of the globe. Building wind farms and maintaining turbine assets also pro- vide numerous job opportunities. As a result, the wind energy sector plays an increasingly important role in the new economy. While being scaled up, efficiency and reliability become the key to making wind energy competitive. With the arrival of the data science and machine learning era, a lot of discus- sions are being made in the related research community and wind industry, contemplating strategies to take full advantage of the potentials and oppor- tunities unleashed by the large amount of data to address the efficiency and reliability challenges.Data Science for Wind Energy arrives at the right time, becoming one of the first dedicated volumes to bridge the gap, and provides expositions of relevant data science methods and abundant case studies, tailored to address research and practical challenges in wind energy applications.},

abstract = {Use of wind power as a major source of energy for the United Kingdom would involve the construction of thousands of large aerogenerators off-shore. Economic appraisal of and optimum siting for such a large network requires reliable knowledge of the off-shore wind field in three dimensions. Systematic variation of the field with time of day and year and the likely variability about the mean values, together with the effect of wind direction are also important. Scarcity of past records, inaccuracy of recording and estimating techniques and the variability of the wind field from year to year are likely to limit the accuracy with which the energy output during the lifetime of an installation can be predicted to something like 30 to 50 per cent.
