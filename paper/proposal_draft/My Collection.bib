abstract = {Use of wind power as a major source of energy for the United Kingdom would involve the construction of thousands of large aerogenerators off-shore. Economic appraisal of and optimum siting for such a large network requires reliable knowledge of the off-shore wind field in three dimensions. Systematic variation of the field with time of day and year and the likely variability about the mean values, together with the effect of wind direction are also important. Scarcity of past records, inaccuracy of recording and estimating techniques and the variability of the wind field from year to year are likely to limit the accuracy with which the energy output during the lifetime of an installation can be predicted to something like 30 to 50 per cent.
